# NN-From-Scratch-With-Backprop
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network with Backpropagation, created from scratch. It's based on the lectures by Andrej Karpathy, which cover the basics of neural networks. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master)  This project aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation.

The notebook is structured to guide you through the process of creating a neural network from the ground up. It includes the initialization of network parameters, the computation of outputs, the calculation of loss using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) method, and the application of backpropagation to adjust the weights and minimize the loss. This is all done step-by-step, with a detailed explanation of each part involved in building the neural network, including the forward pass and backpropagation.

Feel free to clone this repository, explore the notebook, and tweak the parameters to experiment with different aspects of neural network training!
